    <h3>The Emerson</h3>
    <p class="aboutText">Aaron De Sal got an exclusive seat on a sales team consisting of Kaylah LeDon and Mark Chow during a 30 unit condo-conversion project that quickly became one of the most popular buildings in Emeryville. The building sat on the Emeryville/Oakland border walking distance to a few essential businesses.  Residents stored their cars in a rare stackable parking machine offering the most practical approach to space permitted. The Emerson also offered a private rooftop deck to residents who wanted a 360 degree view of the San Francisco Bay Area.   </p>

    <h3>Stage 1075</h3>
    <p class="aboutText">After working with an a-list team, Aaron De Sal was promoted and transferred to downtown San Fransisco to sell 90 edgy new homes on 1075 Market ave. There sure was grit but the vintage trolly cars with old paint and clear bells rolled past a newly renovated "Proper Hotel" and people began to fall in love. People fell in love with the convenience of public transportation, the history of Market street, the vibrant city sunsets. STAGE 1075 kept you in the mix and next door to brand new hotels and people willing to mingle. </p>
